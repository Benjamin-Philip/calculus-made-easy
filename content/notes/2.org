We will have to deal with small quantities of various degrees of smallness. We
will then also need to understand when we can neglect them.

* Smallness

A quantity can be considered small relative to another quantity. Thompson gives
various examples to illustrate this:

- A minute is small compared to a week (there are 10080 minutes in the week).
- A second is an even smaller quantity.
- The erstwhile farthing is small compared to the erstwhile sovereign.
- They both have no importance compared to £1000.

* Orders of Smallness

If we definite a fraction or something to be small, then there exists other
functions of a higher degree of smallness. These are called as order of
"magnitude" by mathematicians. For example:

- Let a minute be small compared to ($\frac{1}{60}$ of) an hour.
- Then a second ($\frac{1}{60}$ of $\frac{1}{60}$ of an hour) is of the second
  order of smallness.
- If 1% (i.e. $\frac{1}{100}$) were a small fraction, 1% of 1% (i.e.
  $\frac{1}{10,000}$) would of the second order of smallness.
- 1% of 1% of 1% (i.e. $\frac{1}{1,000,000}$) would be of the third order of
  smallness.

* Neglecting Quantities

Higher orders of small quantities are negligible if the first order is small
enough itself:

- Let $x$ grew by a small quantity to become $x + dx$.
- Then its square becomes $x^2 + 2x · dx + (dx)^2$.
- $2x · dx$ is not negligible since it is a first order quantity.
- However, we can ignore $(dx)^2$ since it is of the second order.

* A Geometrical Interpretation

The previous example can be interpreted geometrically. Consider a square of
length $x$:

Once $x$ grows by $dx$, it becomes:

However, we can only neglect $(dx)^2$ by setting $dx$ to be small enough:
