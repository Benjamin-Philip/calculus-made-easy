[[https://calculusmadeeasy.org/1.html][Here]], Thompson introduces the two symbols of Calculus:

* $d$
- $d$ means "a little bit of", or "an element of".
- $dx$ means a little bit of $x$.
- These elements can be thought of as infinitesimally small.
* $\int$
- $\int$ is just a long /S/.
- It can be called "the sum of".
- $\int dx$ refers to the sum of the all the little of bits of $x$ which is $x$
  itself.
- Formally, it means the "the integral of", which itself means "the whole of".
